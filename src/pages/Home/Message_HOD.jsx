        Since the biotechnology department started its journey in 2010, the department
has been striving for excellence in teaching and research. We have been
continuously acquiring new capabilities and producing brilliant future scientists.
We recently moved to our newly constructed state-of-the-art building in 2022,
which is in the shape of a chromosome, further asserting our commitment to
excellence. We have 17 world-class research laboratories and a dedicated teaching
laboratory for students. The department offers B.Tech. in Biotechnology and
Bioinformatics, M.Tech. in Medical Biotechnology, and Ph.D. in various
Biotechnology and allied multidisciplinary areas at the forefront. Over the years,
our uniquely formulated and tailored academic programs have attracted the best
students. The total number of students in our department is currently 203. Our
curriculum provides multifaceted opportunities to the students, including
exposure to industrial problems so that we can address critical challenges not
only faced by society but also industries which is the first and foremost
requirement for "AatmaNirbhar Bharat". We also have a unique biannual hands-on
lab training, an out reach programme, for researchers or students from Indian
universities and institutes, and industrial professionals who want to enhance their
wet-lab or computational biology research skills.
